        <p>Hello my name is Jared and my wife, Aimee and I would like to welcome you to our dream of homesteading. Hopefully someday we can make that dream come true, for my webdesign class I thought it would be a good opportunity to learn how to start a homestead and was surprised to learn there is government loans and grants that can help assist someone to get started homesteading. Our goal is to try to get a homestead for ourselves and hopefully encourage other's to do the same.</p>
