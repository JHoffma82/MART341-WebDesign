Framework Styling Elements – Incorporated my bootstrap over hero image and sections for more fluidiity and better responsivess. 
HTML5 Canvas – Added myCanvas between nav bar and sections to enhance style.
JavaScript Functionality – Created circles in myCanvas using Javascript, used width function to adjust width of canvas to viewport size, and add event listener to resize window as needed.
