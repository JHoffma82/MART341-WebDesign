<h1>Why I Chose These Ideas</h1>

<hr />

<h3>Urban Homesteading</h3>
<p>We live in a pretty garden friendly community in Missoula, however there are large swaths of America that are currently living in food deserts. We need to be encouraging people to grow their own food for multiple reasons such as mental health, healthier diet and carbon capturing. Sometimes the idea seems so daunting that oftentimes people wont even try to start a garden, maybe this site could be a fun nudge for people to get inspired to grow.</p>

<h3>Get Me Off The Street</h3>
<p>I think every community in America and across the world is experiecing unprecedented amount of homelessness and this is unacceptable in a modern society with plenty of resources. There is an incredible amount of sludge when it comes to soical welfare programs, hoops to jump through that are legislated to create an idea of no free handouts. My idea is utilizing AI to gather resources based on user's geo location to create a list of things necessary to do to find housing and other resources. A helpful nudge to help people have some sense of control over their lives.</p>

<h3>E-Swap</h3>
<p>The idea came to me when I was organizing my closet and took note of how much e-waste I had accumulated over the decades. Old cellphones, Wii, Xbox, PS2 whatever waste I cant bring myself to throw away in fear of contributing to more soil contamination. I think there is actually an interest for outdated tech that people might prefer dated tech and I think there are people who are in need of tech but are financially constrained. We live ina time where oftentimes we need an email address and cellphone just to get a job and this could help free people up and give them more autonomy.</p>
