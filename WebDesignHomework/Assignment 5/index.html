 <h3>Apartment Homesteading</h3>
 <p>My wife has become an amazing urban gardener and shares a lot of her progress on Facebook. My idea is to create a DIY blog showcasing her garden and offer clever tips to working in a container garden. Visually I would like it to be minimal with simple earth tones of green and brown.</p>

 <h3>Get Me Off the Street</h3>
 <p>Homelessness has become an epidemic in America, I have an idea of developing a site helping unhoused find homes. It would provide a list of what they need to do and who to get ahold of in there area. Visually I would use minimal green again against and eggshell background to make it as calming as possible.</p>

 <h3>E-Swap</h3>
 <p>My last idea is developing a webpage similar to Craig's list that would sync up people who are looking to get rid of their old tech with people who could use it. It would try to localize exchange if possible, but if not both parties could decide how to pay for shipping. I would use black and green background reminiscnet of old consoles like Commodore 64.</p>
