I like the head of my main page, background color looks good and I think the at the head of the page image fits well and is the right homey aesethtic I was trying to go for. A tasks list could be helpful for first time gardener's, I want to expand and get more descriptive for each task with images to coincide with specific task. Having a suggestion forum will be extremely useful becuase there is always some techniques we may have missed or know nothing about. I'm looking forward to expanding my webpage and start cultivating an ubran homesteading community!
