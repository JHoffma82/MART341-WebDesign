<h2 style="text-align: center;">A user friendly guide to urban homesteading</h2>
<hr />
<p>My desire is for this site is for it to be viewed on mobile phones so they can take it with them into the garden and to be user friendly. All in the hopes to better educate and inspire people living rurally to get their hands dirty and reconnect with the planet.</p>

<p>Post-pandemic with rising temperatures and grocery prices, now is the time to consider becoming more self-sufficient. Homesteading was common practice when we didn't rely on supply chains to bring food to our table. I'm not suggesting that we grow <b>ALL</b> of our own <i>food</i>, but that we supplement what we can with fresh produce and possibly be able to share with our friends and neighbors. Perhaps they too will be inspired by the fruits of our collective labor and decide to start growing or raising livestok of their own.</p>
