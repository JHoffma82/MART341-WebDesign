I've decided to choose to develop the urban homesteading website idea because I see a great need for it environmentally, socially and for health. My wife has a plethora of knowledge about the subject and she has a lot of content I think I could work with into the site. I want the site to feel playful and edicational, I'm thinking a soft earthy green on a papyrus while style background.
REFLECTIONS: I had a difficult time with this exercise, initially I wasn't able to see my <h1>, but I figured it out, I had missed a " mark at the end of my text alignment. Adjusting the width was easy enough I thought, but my chicken image wasn't balanced with the other two photos. I'm not sure how to adjust height, so I just found a smaller image and it looks balanced. It looks about how I expected it to look, I like the ancient white background, I'm unsure about the forest green font. I didn't use the float technique, but I will next time. I need to flesh our more meat for my site, like your pumpkin pie recipe, maybe provide a float image with a quick guide on seed germination to get things rolling or growing I should say. Over all I'm pleased with the results and look forward to building off it.
