Div: I used <div> elements to wrap hero video, homesteading topics and media content. I had difficulty balancing my homesteading topics, but learned that I needed to add more text for them to balance. 
Span: I didn't really know where to use span element so I used your idea from your recipes, but instead emphasizing each of the homestead topics. 
Audio: For the audio I was able to find some bird chirping on freesounds that I find relaxing and the file was minimal.
Video: Initially I wasn't going to use a hero video and just use a hero image, but I wasn't finding anything I liked, but found this great fair-use video that kept with the homey aesthetic.
Iframe: It was hard for me to find an iframe that would work with homesteading, I realized a weather widget would be helpful. Initially, I had a difficult time finding a widget that actually worked, but found one on weather & radar. 
Class: Class elemnet was helpful in keeping my <div> elements organized while still maintaing the same style within the body of the page.
Escape Character: I loved your copyright at the bottom of your Cozy Harvest page, it looks professional and brings legitimacy to the page. I used it to copyright Beloved Urban Homesteading.
